[00:11 - 00:12] Rosa: Hi everybody, my name is Alicia
[00:13 - 00:14] Rosa: Welcome back to Top Words
[00:14 - 00:16] Rosa: Today we're going to talk about
[00:16 - 00:22] Rosa: 10 job interview questions and a few responses to those job interview questions
[00:23 - 00:24] Rosa: So let's go
[00:24 - 00:26] Rosa: Tell me a little about yourself
[00:27 - 00:32] Rosa: Statement number one is tell me a little about yourself or tell me a little bit about yourself
[00:33 - 00:38] Rosa: This is a very common interview introduction question or the first question in an interview
[00:38 - 00:39] Rosa: Tell me about yourself
[00:40 - 00:41] Rosa: It's just an open question
[00:41 - 00:45] Rosa: Please share or basically introduce yourself
[00:45 - 00:51] Rosa: This usually means you should share what you studied in college, your work experience, any
[00:51 - 00:57] Rosa: personal projects you've tried to do or have successfully done other experience you think is
[00:57 - 00:58] Rosa: relevant
[00:58 - 01:03] Rosa: So this is an invitation for you to give a general introduction about yourself
[01:03 - 01:08] Rosa: In an example sentence, well I got my bachelor's degree in biochemistry
[01:09 - 01:10] Rosa: How did you hear about the position
[01:12 - 01:14] Rosa: How did you hear about the position
[01:14 - 01:15] Rosa: How did you hear about
[01:15 - 01:16] Rosa: the position
[01:16 - 01:23] Rosa: This question means how did you learn about this job that you are interviewing for
[01:23 - 01:25] Rosa: How did you find this job opening
[01:25 - 01:27] Rosa: So how did you hear about the position
[01:28 - 01:29] Rosa: This is where you can
[01:29 - 01:34] Rosa: explain maybe where you found the information about the job
[01:34 - 01:36] Rosa: So you found it on the internet
[01:36 - 01:37] Rosa: in the newspaper
[01:37 - 01:38] Rosa: You heard from a friend
[01:39 - 01:41] Rosa: You were contacted by a recruiter
[01:41 - 01:42] Rosa: So there are a few
[01:42 - 01:49] Rosa: different ways that you can share with your interviewer how you found the position, how you heard
[01:49 - 01:49] Rosa: about the job
[01:50 - 01:54] Rosa: In a sentence, I found an advertisement about the job on the internet
[01:55 - 01:57] Rosa: Why are you interested in this position
[01:57 - 02:01] Rosa: Next is why are you interested in the position
[02:01 - 02:01] Rosa: Why are
[02:01 - 02:03] Rosa: you interested in the position
[02:03 - 02:07] Rosa: This is your chance to explain why you want this job
[02:10 - 02:11] Rosa: Why are you
[02:11 - 02:12] Rosa: not saying for the money
[02:13 - 02:16] Rosa: Or because there are a lot of attractive people at this company
[02:17 - 02:17] Rosa: I
[02:17 - 02:17] Rosa: don't know
[02:17 - 02:22] Rosa: You should say something in response to this question about your career goals or maybe
[02:22 - 02:28] Rosa: something specific about the company that you like or something very specific about the job
[02:28 - 02:34] Rosa: that is available there and how you feel your skills are a match for that job
[02:35 - 02:36] Rosa: So explain
[02:36 - 02:39] Rosa: why you're interested in that position
[02:39 - 02:42] Rosa: The reason you decided to apply for that job
[02:42 - 02:43] Rosa: In a sentence,
[02:43 - 02:47] Rosa: I think I'm a good fit for the company and its goals
[02:48 - 02:49] Rosa: Why should we hire you
[02:49 - 02:51] Rosa: The next interview
[02:51 - 02:53] Rosa: question is why should we hire you
[02:53 - 02:55] Rosa: Why should we hire you
[02:55 - 02:58] Rosa: So this is your opportunity to explain
[02:58 - 03:02] Rosa: why you feel you are the best candidate for the job
[03:02 - 03:06] Rosa: So if you have any special qualifications,
[03:06 - 03:11] Rosa: you have certifications, you have specific experience, you have a specific goal in mind
[03:11 - 03:12] Rosa: This is the
[03:12 - 03:16] Rosa: kind of question you can share that information in response to
[03:17 - 03:18] Rosa: Why should we hire you
[03:18 - 03:19] Rosa: Because I
[03:19 - 03:25] Rosa: can speak six different languages and I know how to create a website in 10 minutes
[03:25 - 03:26] Rosa: I don't know
[03:26 - 03:26] Rosa: So
[03:27 - 03:33] Rosa: if you have some kind of special qualifications, you can share those qualifications in response to
[03:33 - 03:33] Rosa: this question
[03:34 - 03:38] Rosa: In another example sentence, I'm a goal-oriented person who likes to work at a fast
[03:39 - 03:39] Rosa: pace
[03:40 - 03:42] Rosa: What do you consider your strengths and weaknesses
[03:43 - 03:45] Rosa: The next question is a common question
[03:46 - 03:49] Rosa: What do you consider your strengths and weaknesses
[03:49 - 03:52] Rosa: What do you consider your strengths and weaknesses
[03:52 - 03:54] Rosa: Or what are your strengths and weaknesses
[03:55 - 03:57] Rosa: So strengths means strong points
[03:57 - 03:58] Rosa: Things you are good at
[03:58 - 04:00] Rosa: Weakness is your weak points
[04:00 - 04:02] Rosa: Things you are not very good at
[04:02 - 04:05] Rosa: So you should be honest to a degree
[04:05 - 04:06] Rosa: but be careful
[04:06 - 04:09] Rosa: So this should be in a professional setting
[04:09 - 04:10] Rosa: Keep that in mind
[04:10 - 04:11] Rosa: It's a professional
[04:11 - 04:11] Rosa: setting
[04:12 - 04:17] Rosa: If you want to talk about your weaknesses, don't say like, I eat too much chocolate or don't
[04:17 - 04:19] Rosa: say like, I love sleeping or whatever
[04:19 - 04:22] Rosa: Talk about your professional strengths and your professional
[04:22 - 04:23] Rosa: weaknesses
[04:23 - 04:28] Rosa: And also with your weaknesses, it would be a good idea to talk about how you
[04:28 - 04:35] Rosa: improve those weaknesses or how you work with your team members or work in a company to try to
[04:35 - 04:38] Rosa: reduce the effect of those weaknesses
[04:38 - 04:42] Rosa: So for example, I'm very detail-oriented but I often take
[04:42 - 04:44] Rosa: on too much at one time
[04:45 - 04:47] Rosa: So like in my case, that's the case
[04:47 - 04:49] Rosa: Like I'm very detail-oriented but I
[04:49 - 04:51] Rosa: often take on too much
[04:51 - 04:53] Rosa: So do too many things at one time
[04:54 - 04:56] Rosa: So I could explain, okay, so I'm very
[04:56 - 05:03] Rosa: detail-oriented but if I'm trying to take on too much, I may be, I say, I communicate with my
[05:03 - 05:09] Rosa: coworkers about what should be prioritized and that helps me organize my time better
[05:09 - 05:09] Rosa: So when
[05:09 - 05:15] Rosa: you introduce your weakness, talk about the ways you kind of, you try to reduce the effect of
[05:15 - 05:16] Rosa: that weakness
[05:16 - 05:17] Rosa: That can be one technique
[05:17 - 05:20] Rosa: So your good points and your bad points in this question
[05:20 - 05:23] Rosa: Tell me about a time when you overcame a challenge at work
[05:24 - 05:30] Rosa: Some interviewers may ask this question, tell me about a time when you overcame a challenge at work
[05:30 - 05:31] Rosa: So it's not really a question
[05:32 - 05:33] Rosa: They're asking you to tell a story
[05:34 - 05:35] Rosa: So tell me about a time when
[05:35 - 05:37] Rosa: you overcame a challenge at work
[05:37 - 05:41] Rosa: So they want to hear an example from your professional experience
[05:41 - 05:43] Rosa: about how you solved a problem
[05:44 - 05:46] Rosa: What did you do to solve a problem at work
[05:47 - 05:48] Rosa: They want to know
[05:48 - 05:53] Rosa: what kind of problem it was and how you approached the problem and the result of that problem
[05:54 - 06:00] Rosa: So you could say, for example, our company party was scheduled for the day before Christmas,
[06:00 - 06:04] Rosa: but the restaurant exploded and I had to find a new place to have the party
[06:05 - 06:05] Rosa: I don't know,
[06:05 - 06:12] Rosa: that's not a course of crazy example, but giving your employer an idea of how you solve problems
[06:12 - 06:17] Rosa: and maybe the kind of mental state you have when you solve the problems can be helpful in making
[06:17 - 06:18] Rosa: a hiring decision
[06:19 - 06:23] Rosa: So in an example, when I was having trouble communicating with a client,
[06:23 - 06:26] Rosa: I reached out to a coworker for support
[06:26 - 06:28] Rosa: What are your career goals
[06:29 - 06:30] Rosa: The next question is,
[06:30 - 06:33] Rosa: what are your career goals, your career goals
[06:33 - 06:36] Rosa: So not necessarily in this company, but in your career
[06:36 - 06:37] Rosa: overall
[06:38 - 06:44] Rosa: In the interview, it's probably a good idea to include the company where you are currently
[06:44 - 06:46] Rosa: interviewing in your career goals
[06:47 - 06:52] Rosa: But keep in mind, you should be explaining a goal or you should
[06:52 - 06:57] Rosa: be sharing a goal that is in line with the company's work
[06:58 - 07:01] Rosa: So if your goal is to open a cupcake shop,
[07:01 - 07:09] Rosa: but you're interviewing for an IT job where you're going to be installing Windows 10 on people's
[07:09 - 07:12] Rosa: computers, maybe this doesn't really match
[07:12 - 07:15] Rosa: So make sure that your career goal and the job you're
[07:15 - 07:18] Rosa: interviewing for align, those two should be kind of aligned
[07:19 - 07:21] Rosa: It'll help your interviewer and it
[07:21 - 07:22] Rosa: will help you, I think
[07:22 - 07:27] Rosa: So in an example sentence, I want to create a global advertising campaign
[07:27 - 07:28] Rosa: strategy
[07:28 - 07:31] Rosa: So maybe you're interviewing for a marketing job, for example
[07:31 - 07:32] Rosa: You could say that's your
[07:32 - 07:32] Rosa: career goal
[07:32 - 07:36] Rosa: I would love to design a global marketing campaign strategy, for example
[07:37 - 07:38] Rosa: Where do you
[07:38 - 07:39] Rosa: see yourself in five years
[07:39 - 07:44] Rosa: The next question, a very common one, where do you see yourself in five
[07:44 - 07:44] Rosa: years
[07:45 - 07:46] Rosa: Where do you see yourself in five years
[07:46 - 07:50] Rosa: This question means after five years, five years
[07:50 - 07:54] Rosa: from this point in time, what is your vision for you
[07:54 - 07:57] Rosa: What is your vision of yourself professionally
[07:57 - 08:01] Rosa: So what do you want to have achieved after five years
[08:02 - 08:05] Rosa: So a good tip for this question is to explain
[08:05 - 08:11] Rosa: where you will be having made contributions to the company where you are interviewing
[08:11 - 08:12] Rosa: So if I'm
[08:12 - 08:15] Rosa: interviewing at Apple and Apple says, where do you see yourself in five years, Alicia
[08:16 - 08:16] Rosa: And I say,
[08:16 - 08:19] Rosa: I see myself at Microsoft, like that sounds really bad
[08:20 - 08:24] Rosa: So try to share your goals for yourself
[08:24 - 08:30] Rosa: in a five year period, but again, try to align them with the company where you're interviewing and
[08:30 - 08:35] Rosa: explain like how you plan to contribute to the company and develop yourself professionally
[08:36 - 08:38] Rosa: That can be a really good way to answer this question
[08:38 - 08:41] Rosa: For example, I see myself in a managerial
[08:41 - 08:45] Rosa: position in this company working on multiple projects for multiple markets
[08:47 - 08:48] Rosa: Why do you want to work
[08:48 - 08:48] Rosa: here
[08:49 - 08:51] Rosa: The next question is why do you want to work here
[08:51 - 08:52] Rosa: Why do you want to work here
[08:53 - 08:53] Rosa: So similar to
[08:53 - 08:56] Rosa: why are you interested in this position
[08:56 - 08:59] Rosa: That one's like that question is very much about this job
[08:59 - 09:03] Rosa: in particular, but the question, why do you want to work here
[09:03 - 09:04] Rosa: Means why do you want to work in this
[09:04 - 09:06] Rosa: company, like in this place specifically
[09:07 - 09:10] Rosa: So share something about the company that you like or
[09:10 - 09:11] Rosa: share something
[09:11 - 09:15] Rosa: Some reason the company is attractive to you as a candidate
[09:16 - 09:17] Rosa: So maybe it's the
[09:17 - 09:23] Rosa: location or maybe it's the ability to work overseas or maybe it's an international environment or
[09:23 - 09:25] Rosa: maybe you can use your English skills
[09:26 - 09:29] Rosa: Some reason why you're interested in working at this company
[09:29 - 09:31] Rosa: specifically
[09:31 - 09:32] Rosa: Share that after this question
[09:33 - 09:36] Rosa: So example, I think there's a lot to learn and I think
[09:36 - 09:38] Rosa: there are opportunities for promotion
[09:39 - 09:40] Rosa: Do you have any questions for me
[09:41 - 09:43] Rosa: Last one, the last question
[09:43 - 09:44] Rosa: is very common
[09:44 - 09:46] Rosa: Do you have any questions for me
[09:46 - 09:48] Rosa: Do you have any questions for me
[09:48 - 09:49] Rosa: Interviewers will
[09:49 - 09:55] Rosa: often ask this question at the end of an interview, inviting the candidate to ask questions about
[09:55 - 09:56] Rosa: the company
[09:56 - 10:01] Rosa: It is usually a very good idea to prepare some questions for the interviewer
[10:02 - 10:02] Rosa: So it's
[10:02 - 10:07] Rosa: also a good idea to research your company or research the university you're interviewing for
[10:07 - 10:09] Rosa: before the interview
[10:09 - 10:14] Rosa: So if you have questions about the company, company policy, that sort of thing,
[10:14 - 10:16] Rosa: it's a great chance to ask your interviewer
[10:16 - 10:19] Rosa: Generally, however, it's not a good idea to ask
[10:19 - 10:26] Rosa: specific questions about pay or vacation in the interview as you can be seen as maybe being too
[10:26 - 10:28] Rosa: money or too vacation focused
[10:28 - 10:32] Rosa: That might come a little later if you say, what's the salary for this
[10:32 - 10:32] Rosa: job
[10:33 - 10:38] Rosa: Like, unless it's a situation, unless it's a kind of a closed situation that might be too direct
[10:38 - 10:39] Rosa: to a question
[10:39 - 10:42] Rosa: But instead, ask some things about the company
[10:42 - 10:44] Rosa: Ask your interviewer what it's
[10:44 - 10:45] Rosa: like to work there
[10:45 - 10:50] Rosa: What your interviewer thinks is good about working for the company or maybe what
[10:50 - 10:55] Rosa: your interviewer thinks the company is planning to do over the next few years
[10:55 - 10:56] Rosa: Ask something of your
[10:56 - 10:57] Rosa: interviewer
[10:57 - 11:02] Rosa: So it shows that you are interested in that company and that you want to learn more and
[11:02 - 11:04] Rosa: participate more with that company
[11:04 - 11:08] Rosa: So make sure to have some questions prepared when your interviewer
[11:08 - 11:10] Rosa: asks, do you have any questions for me
[11:10 - 11:14] Rosa: So example question, what do you think is the most rewarding
[11:14 - 11:15] Rosa: part about working here
[11:15 - 11:20] Rosa: So those are our 10 job interview questions and a few different ways you
[11:20 - 11:21] Rosa: can respond to them
[11:22 - 11:26] Rosa: So I think those are useful for job interviews, yes, but maybe if you interview
[11:26 - 11:32] Rosa: for like a university or interview for a scholarship or something, you can use similar responses
[11:32 - 11:33] Rosa: to similar questions
